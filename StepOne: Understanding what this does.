Alright, so this code: loadstring(game:httpget("https://github.com/robloxscriptzuploader/quickexecutor/blob/main/quickexecutorscript.lua"),true)) basically tells roblox to connect to github raw (basically where code is stored) and run it in their servers using the HTTP service: https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HttpService
In this case, the code given connects to Pastebin and creates a post using the :PostAsync() function. But as well as that it gives info to use when posting.
There is many ways to use the HttpService connection, as well as the "TextButton" or "ImageButton" object.



YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY FINISHED STEP 1.
